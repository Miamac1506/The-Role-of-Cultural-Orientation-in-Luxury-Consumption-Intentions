### About

### Introduction
An independent research using SPSS for a multiple regression analysis of data I collected to examine how attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control relate to luxury purchase intentions, and if individualism-collectivism moderates these relationships.

### Data Collection
- Developed a questionnaire focusing on luxury consumption, derived from the Theory of Planned Behavior, and executed data collection across the United States using a prolific survey platform.

Additionally, it includes measurements of attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intention related to luxury consumption.
